# COMP 20

## Purpose of this Git Repository
This repository is a record of my journey in learning how to develop, design, and secure web content. Its purpose is to host this work to be assessed by my instructors, reviewed by myself, and appraised by potential employers.

## Favorite Assignment
My favorite assignment was Assignment 2: The Black Car Service. Though I had some prior interaction with the Google Maps API, my past experience was confusing and frustrating. It was very rewarding to be able to use this tool which had previously perplexed me and create a useful and well-designed application. In addition, I love designing webpages with CSS, so being able to do so with a fleshed out application was really enjoyable.

## Growth
At the beginning of this course, I had just finished COMP40. During COMP40, we work with partners, which taught me a lot about how to share control and manage our time efficiently. However, in COMP20, I feel that those skills have been stretched even more through our semester group project. It has been difficult negotiating the responsibilities and expectations of 4 other group members. From this experience, I feel that I understand more about how I relate with others in a cooperative setting and about how I should relate to them. In the future, I will work to share responsibility more readily and communicate more effectively.

## Most Important Lesson
Coming into this course, I knew some HTML and CS but no JavaScript or databases. Though I really enjoy front-end development, I feel I learned a lot about the back-end and security which will be very beneficial in the future. In particular, I hadn't realized previously how vulnerable so many applications are to attacks. In addition, I don't always remember validation and error-checking when I program, so having that knowledge of vulnerabilities will help me secure my work in the future.

## Topics for Future Education
I'm very eager to learn more about graphics. For our semester group project, we implemeneted the graphics using canva.js. As I'm interested in design and front-end development, building my knowledge base for animations would be really beneficial and interesting.
