# COMP 20: Lab 5 - Annotation

## Purpose
to practice writing JavaScript and using the Document Object Model, as well as to understand event handling and first-class functions, by captioning Mariah Carey's 2016 New Year's Eve (failed) performance of "Emotions."

## Implementation
All specifications were correctly implemented; however, timing of the lyrics was difficult as there are not many cues from the video as to what lyrics Mariah Carey should have sang when. In addition, future improvements might include enhanced styling, particularly regarding font family and colored wrapping containers.

## Time Dedicated
2 hours
