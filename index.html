        <li><a href="https://float-four.herokuapp.com">Semester Project: Float Four</a><p>Float Four is adds a new dimension of strategy to the classic game Connect Four. Players can, at their will, reverse the direction of gravity, causing the pieces to float to the top of the board and therefore altering the relationships between them.</p></li>
        <li><a href="https://selena-groh.github.io/comp20-sgroh/notuber-client">The Client for The Black Car Service</a><p>This client-side of a ride request application was implemented in order to enhance my understanding of JSON APIs, third-party JavaScript APIs, HTML5 Geolocation, and XMLHttpRequest.</p></li>
        <li><a href="https://salty-harbor-98104.herokuapp.com">The Server for The Black Car Service</a><p>This simple server-side web application for The Black Car Service was implemented using node.js, MongoDB, and Heroku in order to understand how a web server serves dynamic and static content.</p></li>
        <li><a href="https://selena-groh.github.io/comp20-sgroh/security">Security and Privacy</a><p>A security assessment of a vulnerable web application.</p></li>
        <li><a href="https://selena-groh.github.io/comp20-sgroh/responsive">Responsive Design</a><p>This lab provided practice in using sprites, CSS, media queries, and responsive design by displaying different parts of an image at different browser width ranges.</p></li>
        <li><a href="https://selena-groh.github.io/comp20-sgroh/annotation">Annotation</a><p>I captioned Mariah Carey's 2016 New Year's Eve performance of "Emotions" in order to practice writing JavaScript and using the Document Object Model, as well as to understand event handling and first-class functions.</p></li>

      <h3>Favorite Assignment</h3>
      <p>My favorite assignment was The Client for The Black Car Service. Though I had some prior interaction with the Google Maps API, my past experience was confusing and frustrating. It was very rewarding to be able to use this tool which had previously perplexed me and create a useful and well-designed application. In addition, I love designing webpages with CSS, so being able to do so with a fleshed out application was really enjoyable.</p>

      <h3>Most Important Lesson</h3>
      <p>Coming into this course, I knew some HTML and CS but no JavaScript or databases. Though I really enjoy front-end development, I feel I learned a lot about the back-end and security which will be very beneficial in the future. In particular, I hadn't realized previously how vulnerable so many applications are to attacks. In addition, I don't always remember validation and error-checking when I program, so having that knowledge of vulnerabilities will help me secure my work in the future.</p>

      <h3>Topics for Future Education</h3>
      <p>I'm very eager to learn more about graphics. For our semester group project, Float Four, we implemented the graphics using crafty.js. As I'm interested in design and front-end development, building my knowledge base for animations would be really beneficial and interesting.</p>
