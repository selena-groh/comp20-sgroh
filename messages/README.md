# COMP 20: Lab 7 - Messages

## Purpose
to practice using jQuery by reimplementing the messages.html example from class using jQuery

## Implementation
All specifications were correctly implemented as the index.html output matches the output of the messages.html example from class. However, I am unclear on jQuery formatting conventions such as whether it is better to write the callback function within the call or separately.

## Time Dedicated
30 minutes
